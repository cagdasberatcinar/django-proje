          <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,
          until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
          element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and
          hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or
          overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML
          can go within the <strong>.accordion-body</strong>, though the transition does
          limit overflow.
